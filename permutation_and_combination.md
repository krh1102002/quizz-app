### Q1.

In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'OPTICAL' be arranged so that the vowels always come together?

A) 120
B) 720
C) 840
D) 920

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The word 'OPTICAL' contains 7 letters.
Vowels are O, I, A (3 vowels).
Consonants are P, T, C, L (4 consonants).
Since vowels must come together, treat (O, I, A) as one unit.
Now we have 4 consonants + 1 unit = 5 items.
Number of ways to arrange these 5 items = 5! = 120.
The 3 vowels (O, I, A) can be arranged among themselves in 3! = 6 ways.
Total number of ways = 120 Ã— 6 = **720**.

### Q2.

How many 3-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9, which are divisible by 5 and none of the digits is repeated?

A) 5
B) 10
C) 15
D) 20

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Digits are 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9.
Total digits available = 6.
For a number to be divisible by 5, the unit digit must be 5.
So, the unit digit is fixed as 5 (1 way).
Remaining 2 positions can be filled by the remaining 5 digits (2, 3, 6, 7, 9).
Number of ways to fill 2 positions from 5 digits = P(5, 2) = 5 Ã— 4 = **20**.

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Number of ways to select 5 men from 7 = C(7, 5) = C(7, 2) = (7 Ã— 6) / (2 Ã— 1) = 21.
Number of ways to select 2 women from 3 = C(3, 2) = C(3, 1) = 3.

### Q5.

In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'CORPORATION' be arranged so that the vowels always come together?

A) 810
B) 1440
C) 2880
D) 50400

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Word 'CORPORATION' has 11 letters.
Vowels: O, O, A, I, O (5 vowels).
Consonants: C, R, P, R, T, N (6 consonants).
Treat vowels as one unit.
Items to arrange = 6 consonants + 1 unit = 7 items.
Among consonants, 'R' is repeated 2 times.
Ways to arrange 7 items = 7! / 2! = 5040 / 2 = 2520.
Arrangement of vowels (O, O, O, A, I): 5 letters, O repeated 3 times.
Ways to arrange vowels = 5! / 3! = 120 / 6 = 20.
Total ways = 2520 Ã— 20 = **50400**.

---

### Q6.

Out of 7 consonants and 4 vowels, how many words of 3 consonants and 2 vowels can be formed?

A) 210
B) 25200
C) 21300
D) None of these

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Ways to select 3 consonants from 7 = C(7, 3) = (7 Ã— 6 Ã— 5) / (3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1) = 35.
Ways to select 2 vowels from 4 = C(4, 2) = (4 Ã— 3) / (2 Ã— 1) = 6.
Total selection = 35 Ã— 6 = 210.
Each word has 5 letters (3C + 2V), which can be arranged in 5! = 120 ways.
Total words = 210 Ã— 120 = **25200**.

---

### Q7.

A) 159
B) 194
C) 205
D) 209

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Total children = 6 + 4 = 10.
Ways to select 4 children from 10 = C(10, 4) = (10 Ã— 9 Ã— 8 Ã— 7) / (4 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1) = 210.
Ways to select 4 children with NO boy (all girls) = C(4, 4) = 1.
Ways with at least one boy = Total - (No boy) = 210 - 1 = **209**.

---

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Majority of ladies in a team of 5 means either 3, 4, or 5 ladies.
Case 1: 3 Ladies and 2 Gentlemen
Ways = C(4, 3) Ã— C(6, 2) = 4 Ã— 15 = 60.
Case 2: 4 Ladies and 1 Gentleman
Ways = C(4, 4) Ã— C(6, 1) = 1 Ã— 6 = 6.
Case 3: 5 Ladies (Not possible as only 4 ladies available).

Total balls = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.
Total ways to draw 3 balls = C(9, 3) = (9 Ã— 8 Ã— 7) / (3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1) = 84.
Ways to draw NO black ball (select from white and red) = C(6, 3) = (6 Ã— 5 Ã— 4) / (3 Ã— 2 Ã— 1) = 20.
At least one black ball = 84 - 20 = **64**.

**Explanation:**
Word 'DETAIL' has 6 letters.
Vowels: E, A, I (3).
Consonants: D, T, L (3).
Odd positions are 1, 3, 5. (Total 3 positions).
3 vowels can be placed in 3 odd positions in 3! = 6 ways.
Remaining 3 consonants can be placed in remaining 3 positions in 3! = 6 ways.
Total ways = 6 Ã— 6 = **36**.
