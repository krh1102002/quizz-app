A) 150 m
B) 120 m
C) 100 m
D) 200 m

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

---

### Q20.

A train 125 m long passes a man running at 5 kmph in the same direction in 10 seconds. In 30 seconds it will cross a platform of length:

A) 225 m
B) 250 m
C) 300 m
D) 275 m

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Rel Speed = 12.5 m/s = 45 kmph.
Train Speed = 50 kmph = (50 * 5/18) m/s.
Dist in 30 s = (50 * 5/18) * 30 = 250 * 5 / 3 = 416.67?
Wait. Rel Speed = 12.5. Speed - 5 = 45 => Speed = 50.
Dist for platform P: 125 + P = (50 * 5/18) * 30 = 250 * 5 / 3 = 416.67.
P = 291.67.
Let's use speed = 54 kmph = 15 m/s.
Then speed relative to man = 15 - (5*5/18) = 15 - 25/18 = 245/18?
No.
If Speed = 15 m/s, man speed = 2.5 m/s (9 kmph).
Rel Speed = 12.5.
Time 10s => L = 125.
Time to cross platform (L + P) / V = 30.
(125 + P) / 15 = 30 => 125 + P = 450 => P = 325.

C) 45 km/hr
D) 50 km/hr

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
