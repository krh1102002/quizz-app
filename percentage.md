## Batch 1 (Questions 1–25)

### Q1

A student scored 45 marks out of 60 in a test. What is the percentage of marks obtained?

A. 70%
B. 72%
C. 75%
D. 80%

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Percentage = (Obtained marks / Total marks) × 100 = (45 / 60) × 100 = 0.75 × 100 = 75%

---

### Q2

A shopkeeper sold an article at Rs. 560, making a profit of 12%. What was the cost price?

A. 500
B. 480
C. 520
D. 450

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Let the cost price (CP) be x. Profit = 12% of CP => SP = CP + Profit = x + 0.12x = 1.12x
Given SP = 560 => 1.12x = 560 => x = 560 / 1.12 = 500
Hence, CP = Rs. 500

---

### Q3

The population of a town increased from 20,000 to 22,000 in a year. Find the percentage increase.

A. 10%
B. 11%
C. 12%
D. 15%

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Increase = New population − Original population = 22,000 − 20,000 = 2,000
Percentage increase = (Increase / Original population) × 100 = (2,000 / 20,000) × 100 = 10%

---

### Q4

An article is sold at Rs. 1,120 after allowing a discount of 20%. What was the marked price?

A. 1,200
B. 1,400
C. 1,500
D. 1,600

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Selling price (SP) = Marked Price (MP) × (1 − Discount%)
1120 = MP × (1 − 0.20) => 1120 = 0.8 × MP => MP = 1120 / 0.8 = 1,400
Hence, the marked price = Rs. 1,400

---

### Q5

A person spends 40% of his income and saves Rs. 6,000. Find his income.

A. 10,000
B. 15,000
C. 20,000
D. 25,000

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Savings = 100% − 40% = 60% of income
Let income = x => 60% of x = 6,000 => 0.6x = 6,000 => x = 6,000 / 0.6 = 10,000 ❌
Correct calculation: 6,000 ÷ 0.6 = 10,000
✅ Hence, income = Rs. 10,000 (adjusted)

---

### Q7

A car's price is increased by 10%, then reduced by 10%. What is the net change in price?

A. No change
B. 1% increase
C. 1% decrease
D. 2% decrease

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Let original price = 100
After 10% increase: 100 + 10% of 100 = 100 + 10 = 110
After 10% decrease: 110 − 10% of 110 = 110 − 11 = 99
Net change = 100 − 99 = 1% decrease

---

### Q8

A. 5,40,000
B. 5,50,000
C. 5,60,000
D. 5,80,000

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
New value = CP + 8% of CP = 5,00,000 + (8/100) × 5,00,000 = 5,00,000 + 40,000 = 5,40,000
