# Logical Reasoning - Statement and Conclusion MCQs

### Q1.
**Problem:** 
**Statement:** "In a one-day cricket match, the total runs made by a team were 200. Out of these, 160 runs were made by spinners."
**Conclusions:**
I. 80% of the team consists of spinners.
II. The opening batsmen were spinners.

A) Only conclusion I follows
B) Only conclusion II follows
C) Either I or II follows
D) Neither I nor II follows

**Answer:** D
**Explanation:**
1. Conclusion I doesn't follow because scoring 80% of runs doesn't mean 80% of players are spinners. One or two spinners could score all these runs.
2. Conclusion II doesn't follow because there's no information about the batting order.

II. Discard old ideas because they are old.

A) Only conclusion I follows

### Q17.
**Problem:** 
**Statement:** "All those who have high blood pressure should avoid spicy food."
**Conclusions:**
I. Spicy food causes high blood pressure.
II. Some people have high blood pressure.

A) Neither I nor II follows
B) Only I follows
C) Only II follows
D) Both follow

**Answer:** A
**Explanation:**
1. Statement says spicy food should be "avoided," not that it's the "cause."
2. Statement starts with "All those who have...", which is a conditional, not a confirmation that such people exist in reality (though common sense says they do, logic looks at the statement). However, in many logic tests, "All A are B" implies A exists. But here, conclusion II is trivial and doesnt strictly "follow" as a deduction from the logic of blood pressure management.
