### Q1.

A person crosses a 600 m long street in 5 minutes. What is his speed in km per hour?

A) 3.6
B) 7.2
C) 8.4
D) 10

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Speed = Distance / Time
Distance = 600 m
Time = 5 minutes = 5 * 60 = 300 seconds
Speed in m/s = 600 / 300 = 2 m/s
Speed in km/hr = 2 * (18/5) = 36/5 = 7.2 km/hr.

### Q2.

If a person walks at 14 km/hr instead of 10 km/hr, he would have walked 20 km more. The actual distance travelled by him is:

A) 50 km
B) 56 km
C) 70 km
D) 80 km

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Let the actual distance be x km.
Time taken = x / 10
If speed = 14 km/hr, distance = x + 20.
Time = (x + 20) / 14.
Since time is the same: x / 10 = (x + 20) / 14
14x = 10x + 200
4x = 200 => x = 50 km.

D) 20

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Due to stoppages, it covers 9 km less per hour (54 - 45 = 9).
Time taken to cover 9 km at 54 kmph = (9/54) * 60 minutes = (1/6) * 60 = 10 minutes.

### Q6.

A train can travel 50% faster than a car. Both start from point A at the same time and reach point B 75 kms away from A at the same time. On the way, however, the train lost about 12.5 minutes while stopping at the stations. The speed of the car is:

A) 100 kmph
B) 110 kmph
C) 120 kmph
D) 130 kmph

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Let speed of car = x kmph.
Speed of train = 1.5x kmph.
Time taken by car = 75 / x.
Time taken by train = (75 / 1.5x) + (12.5 / 60).
75 / x = 50 / x + 12.5 / 60
25 / x = 12.5 / 60
x = (25 * 60) / 12.5 = 120 kmph.

### Q7.

In a flight of 600 km, an aircraft was slowed down due to bad weather. Its average speed for the trip was reduced by 200 km/hr and the time of flight increased by 30 minutes. The duration of the flight is:

A) 1 hour
B) 2 hours
C) 3 hours
D) 4 hours

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Let original speed = x. Original time = 600/x.
New speed = x - 200. New time = 600 / (x - 200).
600 / (x - 200) - 600/x = 0.5
600x - 600(x - 200) = 0.5x(x - 200)
120000 = 0.5x^2 - 100x
x^2 - 200x - 240000 = 0
(x - 600)(x + 400) = 0
x = 600 km/hr.
Original duration = 600 / 600 = 1 hour.

---

### Q8.

A man on tour travels first 160 km at 64 km/hr and the next 160 km at 80 km/hr. The average speed for the first 320 km of the tour is:

A) 35.55 km/hr
B) 36 km/hr
C) 71.11 km/hr
D) 71 km/hr

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Average speed = total distance / total time
Time 1 = 160 / 64 = 2.5 hours
Time 2 = 160 / 80 = 2 hours
Total distance = 320 km.
Total time = 4.5 hours.
Average speed = 320 / 4.5 = 71.11 km/hr.

### Q9.

Robert is travelling on his cycle and has calculated to reach point A at 2 P.M. if he travels at 10 kmph; he will reach there at 12 noon if he travels at 15 kmph. At what speed must he travel to reach A at 1 P.M. ?

A) 8 kmph
B) 11 kmph
C) 12 kmph
D) 14 kmph

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Let distance = d.
d/10 - d/15 = 2 hours
(3d - 2d) / 30 = 2 => d = 60 km.
Time taken at 10 kmph = 6 hours.
Arrival at 2 P.M. means he started at 8 A.M.
To reach at 1 P.M., he needs to take 5 hours for 60 km.
Speed = 60 / 5 = 12 kmph.

### Q10.

A car travelling with 5/7 of its actual speed covers 42 km in 1 hr 40 min 48 sec. Find the actual speed of the car.

A) 17 6/7 km/hr
B) 25 km/hr
C) 30 km/hr
D) 35 km/hr

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Time = 1 hr + 40/60 hr + 48/3600 hr = 1 + 2/3 + 1/75 = (75+50+1)/75 = 126/75 hours.
Speed used = Distance / Time = 42 / (126/75) = (42*75)/126 = 25 km/hr.
5/7 * Actual Speed = 25
Actual Speed = 25 * 7 / 5 = 35 km/hr.
