### Q12.

A vessel is filled with liquid, 3 parts of which are water and 5 parts syrup. How much of the mixture must be drawn off and replaced with water so that the mixture may be half water and half syrup?

A) 1/5
B) 1/4
C) 1/3
D) 1/7

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Initial Ratio W:S = 3:5.
Let volume be 8. Water = 3, Syrup = 5.
Let x mix be replaced by water.
New Syrup = 5 - (5/8)x = 4 (half of 8)
1 = (5/8)x => x = 8/5.
Part of mixture = (8/5) / 8 = 1/5.

---

### Q13.

Two vessels A and B contain milk and water mixed in the ratio 8 : 5 and 5 : 2 respectively. The ratio in which these two mixtures be mixed to get a new mixture containing milk and water in the ratio 9 : 4 is:

A) 2 : 7
B) 7 : 2
C) 5 : 2
D) 2 : 5

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Milk in A = 8/13. Milk in B = 5/7.
Milk in Mix = 9/13.
Alligation:
8/13 | 5/7
9/13
Difference 1 = 5/7 - 9/13 = (65 - 63) / 91 = 2/91.
Difference 2 = 9/13 - 8/13 = 1/13.
Ratio = 2/91 : 1/13 = 2/91 : 7/91 = 2 : 7.
Wait, 8/13, 5/7, 9/13.
5/7 - 9/13 = (65-63)/91 = 2/91.
9/13 - 8/13 = 1/13.
Ratio = 2/91 : 7/91 = 2 : 7.
Option A is 2:7.

### Q17.

Two alloys A and B contain gold and copper in the ratio 2 : 3 and 3 : 7 by weight respectively. If these alloys are melted and mixed in the ratio 5 : 2, find the ratio of gold and copper in the new alloy.

A) 13 : 22
B) 5 : 9
C) 4 : 7
D) 3 : 8

**Answer:** A
