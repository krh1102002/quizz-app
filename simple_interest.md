### Q1.

Find the simple interest on ₹68,000 at 16 2/3% per annum for 9 months.

A) ₹8,500
B) ₹8,000
C) ₹9,000
D) ₹7,500

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
P = ₹68,000. R = 50/3 %. T = 9/12 = 3/4 years.
SI = (P * R * T) / 100 = (68000 * 50/3 * 3/4) / 100
SI = (680 * 50 * 1/4) = 170 * 50 = ₹8,500.

### Q2.

A sum of ₹1,600 gives a simple interest of ₹252 in 2 years and 3 months. The rate of interest per annum is:

A) 7%
B) 8%
C) 9%
D) 6%

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
SI = ₹252. P = ₹1,600. T = 2.25 years = 9/4 years.
R = (SI * 100) / (P * T) = (252 * 100) / (1600 * 9/4)
R = (252) / (4 * 9) = 252 / 36 = 7%.

### Q3.

A sum of money at simple interest amounts to ₹815 in 3 years and to ₹854 in 4 years. The sum is:

A) ₹698
B) ₹700
C) ₹650
D) ₹690

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
SI for 1 year = ₹(854 - 815) = ₹39.
SI for 3 years = 39 * 3 = ₹117.
Sum = Amount(3) - SI(3) = 815 - 117 = ₹698.

### Q4.

Mr. Thomas invested an amount of ₹13,900 divided in two different schemes A and B at the simple interest rate of 14% p.a. and 11% p.a. respectively. If the total amount of simple interest earned in 2 years be ₹3,508, what was the amount invested in Scheme B?

A) ₹6,400
B) ₹7,500
C) ₹7,200
D) ₹6,500

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Let amount in B be x. Amount in A = 13900 - x.
Total SI = [ (13900 - x) * 14 * 2 / 100 ] + [ x * 11 * 2 / 100 ] = 3508
28(13900 - x) + 22x = 350800
389200 - 28x + 22x = 350800
6x = 38400 => x = ₹6,400.

### Q5.

A sum of money trebles itself in 15 years 6 months. In how many years would it double itself?

A) 7 years 9 months
B) 8 years
C) 8 years 3 months
D) 9 years

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Let Sum = P. Amount = 3P. SI = 2P.
T = 15.5 years.
R = (2P * 100) / (P * 15.5) = 200 / 15.5 = 400 / 31 %.
For Amount = 2P, SI = P.
T = (P * 100) / (P * 400/31) = 100 * 31 / 400 = 31/4 = 7.75 years.
T = 7 years 9 months.

---

### Q6.

How much time will it take for an amount of ₹450 to yield ₹81 as interest at 4.5% per annum of simple interest?

A) 4 years
B) 3 years
C) 5 years
D) 6 years

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
T = (81 * 100) / (450 * 4.5) = 8100 / (450 * 4.5) = 18 / 4.5 = 4 years.

---

### Q7.

Reena took a loan of ₹1,200 with simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest. If she paid ₹432 as interest at the end of the loan period, what was the rate of interest?

A) 6%
B) 18%
C) 12%
D) 8%

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
SI = (P * R * T) / 100. Given R = T.
432 = (1200 * R^2) / 100
432 = 12 * R^2
R^2 = 36 => R = 6.

---

### Q8.

A sum of ₹12,500 amounts to ₹15,500 in 4 years at the rate of simple interest. What is the rate of interest?

A) 6%
B) 5%
C) 4%
D) 8%

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
SI = 15500 - 12500 = ₹3,000.
R = (3000 * 100) / (12500 * 4) = 300000 / 50000 = 6%.

---

### Q9.

An amount of ₹1,00,000 is invested in two types of shares. The first yields an interest of 9% p.a. and the second, 11% p.a. If the total interest at the end of one year is 9 3/4 %, then the amount invested in each share was:

A) ₹62,500 ; ₹37,500
B) ₹57,500 ; ₹42,500
C) ₹72,500 ; ₹27,500
D) ₹82,500 ; ₹17,500

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Using Alligation:
9% | 11%
9.75%
1.25 : 0.75 = 5 : 3.
Share 1 = (5/8) * 100000 = 62,500.
Share 2 = (3/8) * 100000 = 37,500.

### Q10.

A person borrows ₹5,000 for 2 years at 4% p.a. simple interest. He immediately lends it to another person at 6 1/4 % p.a. for 2 years. Find his gain in the transaction per year.

A) ₹112.50
B) ₹125
C) ₹150
D) ₹167.50

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**

B) ₹225
C) ₹250
D) ₹240

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
T = 146 / 365 = 2/5 years.
SI = (7200 * 8 * 2/5) / 100 = 72 * 16 / 5 = 1152 / 5 = ₹230.40.

---

### Q12.

At what rate of simple interest per annum can a sum of money double in 8 years?

A) 12.5%
B) 10%
C) 15%

A) 6 2/3 %, 6 2/3 years
B) 5%, 5 years
C) 6%, 6 years
D) 7%, 7 years

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
SI = 4/9 P. R = T.
4/9 P = (P * R * R) / 100
R^2 = 400 / 9 => R = 20 / 3 = 6 2/3.

---

A) ₹27.30
B) ₹22.50
C) ₹25
D) ₹30

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Days: March(22) + April(30) + May(21) = 73 days.
T = 73/365 = 1/5 years.
SI = (1820 * 15/2 * 1/5) / 100 = (1820 * 3) / 200 = 5460 / 200 = ₹27.30.

---

### Q17.

### Q18.

If the simple interest on a certain sum of money for 15 months at 7 1/2% p.a. exceeds the simple interest on the same sum for 8 months at 12 1/2% p.a. by ₹32.50, then the sum (in ₹) is:

A) ₹3,000
B) ₹3,120
C) ₹3,250
D) ₹3,125

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
P * [ (15/12 * 7.5) - (8/12 * 12.5) ] / 100 = 32.5
P * [ (5/4 * 15/2) - (2/3 * 25/2) ] / 100 = 32.5
P * [ 75/8 - 25/3 ] / 100 = 32.5
P * [ (225 - 200) / 24 ] / 100 = 32.5
P * (25/2400) = 32.5
P = (32.5 * 2400) / 25 = 1.3 * 2400 = ₹3,120.

---

### Q19.

A sum of ₹1,550 was lent partly at 5% and partly at 8% simple interest. The total interest received after 3 years is ₹300. The ratio of money lent at 5% to that at 8% is:

A) 16 : 15
B) 31 : 6
C) 8 : 5
D) 5 : 8

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Avg rate for 3 years = (300 / 1550) * 100 % = 600 / 31 %.
Rate per year = 200/31 %.
Alligation:
5 (155/31) | 8 (248/31)
200/31
Difference 1 = 248 - 200 = 48.
Difference 2 = 200 - 155 = 45.
Ratio = 48 : 45 = 16 : 15.

A) 4%
B) 5%
C) 2.5%
D) 3%

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
SI for 1.5 years = 1067.20 - 1012 = 55.20.
SI for 1 year = 55.2 / 1.5 = 36.8.
SI for 2.5 years = 36.8 * 2.5 = 92.
Sum = 1012 - 92 = 920.
R = (36.8 * 100) / 920 = 4%.

4 * 12 = 48%. 3 * 10 = 30%.
Difference = 18%.
18% of P = 600 => P = 60000 / 18 = 10000 / 3 = 3333.33.
Let's use difference ₹720. 72000 / 18 = 4000.
