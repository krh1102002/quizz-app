❌ Quiz Pipes & Cistern - Practice Set 2 (695275f59fd80ce7145afbea): Q22 mismatch.
   Correct Index: 0 -> A
   Explanation says: "Option B"
   Options: ["6 AM next day","7 AM next day","8 AM next day","Cannot be filled"]
   Explanation Full: 1-2 PM (A): 1/8.
2-3 PM (A+B): 1/8 + 1/12 = 5/24.
At 3 PM: 1/8 + 5/24 = 8/24 = 1/3 filled.
Remaining: 2/3.
Net rate (3 PM+): 1/8 + 1/12 - 1/6 = (3+2-4)/24 = 1/24.
Time to fill rest: (2/3)/(1/24) = 16 hours.
3 PM + 16 hours = 7 AM next day.
Wait, 3+12 = 3 AM. +4 = 7 AM.
Answer = **7 AM next day** (Option B)

❌ Quiz Time & Distance - Full Test (695275f59fd80ce7145afc3a): Q2 mismatch.
   Correct Index: 2 -> C
   Explanation says: "Option B"
   Options: ["30 minutes","35 minutes","40 minutes","45 minutes"]
   Explanation Full: Let the distance be D.
D/20 - D/30 = (10 + 5) / 60 = 15/60 = 1/4 hour.
D/60 = 1/4 => D = 15 km.
Time at 20 km/hr = 15 / 20 = 3/4 hour = 45 minutes.
Correct time = 45 - 10 = 35 minutes.
Wait, let me re-calculate.
D/20 - D/30 = 15/60 = 1/4.
3D - 2D = 30 => D = 15. Correct.
Time taken at 20 kmph = 15/20 = 45 mins. Late by 10 mins => Correct time 35 mins.
Time taken at 30 kmph = 15/30 = 30 mins. Early by 5 mins => Correct time 35 mins.
Option B is 35 minutes.
