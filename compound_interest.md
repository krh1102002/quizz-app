A) ₹2,100
B) ₹2,000
C) ₹2,200
D) ₹1,900

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Amount = P(1 + R/100)^n = 10000(1 + 10/100)^2 = 10000(1.1)^2 = 12100.
CI = Amount - P = 12100 - 10000 = ₹2,100.

A) ₹2,497.28
B) ₹2,400
C) ₹2,500.50
D) ₹2,600

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
P = ₹20,000. R = 16% p.a. = 4% per quarter. n = 3 quarters.
Amount = 20000(1 + 4/100)^3 = 20000(1.04)^3 = 20000 * 1.124864 = ₹22,497.28.
CI = 22497.28 - 20000 = ₹2497.28.

A) ₹625
B) ₹630
C) ₹640
D) ₹650

P = ₹625.

---

### Q7.

If the compound interest on a sum for 2 years at 12 1/2 % p.a. is ₹510, the simple interest on the same sum at the same rate for the same period of time is:

A) ₹480
B) ₹450
C) ₹460
D) ₹400

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Let P be the sum. R = 12.5% = 1/8.
Amount = P(1 + 1/8)^2 = P(9/8)^2 = 81P/64.
CI = 81P/64 - P = 17P/64.
17P/64 = 510 => P/64 = 30 => P = ₹1,920.
SI = (1920 * 12.5 * 2) / 100 = 1920 * 0.25 = ₹480.

---

### Q8.

A) ₹4,000
B) ₹4,200
C) ₹4,500
D) ₹3,800

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Interest on ₹4840 for 1 year = 5324 - 4840 = ₹484.
R = (484 / 4840) * 100 = 10%.
P(1 + 10/100)^2 = 4840
P(1.21) = 4840 => P = 4000.

---

### Q9.

The difference between compound interest and simple interest on a sum of ₹15,000 for 2 years is ₹96. What is the rate of interest p.a.?

A) 8%
B) 10%
C) 12%
D) 7%

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
96 = 15000(R/100)^2
96 / 15000 = (R/100)^2
6.4 / 1000 = (R/100)^2
0.0064 = (R/100)^2
0.08 = R/100 => R = 8%.
